## Why I don’t summarize 2018 and I don’t prepare goals for the next year?

_In this post I wrote my own opinions. This works fine for me. You may have your own experiences and my methods may not match for you._

Why I don’t summarize past year? Because my year doesn't end on December 31 and doesn't start on January 01 🎆😉

Mainly I could divide things to do and goals in two groups:

- The first group are things that does not depend on seasons 🧘
- The second group are to-dos and plans which depends on changing seasons 🚴⛷️

### I'll give you a few examples. Things that are not depended on seasons:

- Relations with family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. I don’t take the New Year's resolutions about relations. If you want to  improve or repair your relations with family or friends, don’t waste your time and wait for the New Year or special occasion. Take your phone and call them quickly. Meet with them.

- Learning new things 🤔. I have a schedule for that. My schedule is short, mid and long term. I don’t need to take the New Year's resolutions for that. I don’t summarize at the end of year what I have learnt. I summarize myself (relations, actions, learning path, new skills, etc) very often – many times over the month. I’ve used this method not only for job skills but for all. It helps me to stay on a good course.

- I don’t like to take part in book reading challenges 📚. I read a lot, not only books (articles, essays, blogs…). When I finish reading a book I’ll take the next one.

### And the last example, which depends on seasons:

- The gardening year 🌱 ends late autumn and gardening year begins then. The end of the year is time to clean everything – leafs, grass, tools. It’s time to prepare plants for the winter. It's good time to summarize last four seasons. But what with the plans for next four seasons?I'm preparing a plan for the next four seasons long before (in the beginning of spring).

### It's almost the end.

Maybe my tips aren’t quite for you. Probably your life is different and you need or can summarize at the end of the year. However, I encourage you to make summaries much more often than once a year. Thanks to this you will know faster and easier where you are implementing the plan and you will be able to make adjustments. Be agile 🤣🤣🤣
